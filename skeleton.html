        As the clock strikes midnight, the lights in the abandoned museum flicker to life, casting eerie shadows across the exhibits. 
        The air grows cold, and you can hear faint whispers and bone-chilling creaks. 
        Suddenly, the skeletons begin to move, their skeletal joints grinding as they inch closer, their hollow eye sockets fixed on you. 
        You must unravel the mystery of the haunted skeleton exhibit and find a way to escape before you become part of the macabre display. 
        Are the skeletal remains seeking revenge or a chance at redemption? 
        Your survival depends on your wits and courage as you navigate this bone-chilling nightmare.
